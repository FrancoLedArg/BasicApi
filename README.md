## Porpuse of the API

This API provides a robust foundation for building and managing an e-commerce platform. It serves two main user groups:

1. Customers (End Users)

Customers interact with the API to browse products, manage their shopping carts, and complete purchases. Their main goals include:

- Browsing & Searching Products: Find products using categories, filters and search queries.
- Adding to Cart & Wishlist: Save items for later or add them to the shopping cart.
- Checkout & Payments: Securely place orders and complete payments.
- Order Tracking & History: View past orders, track shipments, and request returns.
- User Authentication & Profiles: Create accounts, manage profiles, and save payment/shipping details.

2. Store Owners & Managers (Admins)

Admins use the API to manage products, orders, and users. Their primary objectives are:

- Product Management: Add, update, or remove products and categories.
- Order Processing: View, update, or cancel orders.
- User & Role Management: Manage customer accounts, assign roles (admin, customer support, etc.).
- Analytics & Reports: Generate reports on sales, revenue, and customer behavior.
- Inventory Management: Track stock levels and prevent overselling.
